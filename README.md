This project was my plaground which I have learned State Management with. There are two animations which caused some problems, with *Notify Listeners* and madde this project a little bit challenging for such a newbie as myself. I know that app isn't too beautiful, but I preferred to focus on State Management and move forward with another project. Any advice of how to improve the code is welcome!
